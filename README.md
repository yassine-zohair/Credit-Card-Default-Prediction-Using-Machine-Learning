**Strategic Thinking – Credit Card Default Prediction Using Machine Learning**

**Project Objective:**
Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will default on their credit card payment, helping banks make data-driven decisions for risk management and customer support.

Key Strategic Decisions & Approach:

**Business Understanding:**

Identified the problem: Reduce financial risk by predicting potential credit card defaults.

Determined business impact: Early identification of high-risk customers allows targeted interventions and reduces losses.

**Data Understanding & Preparation:**

Collected and explored customer data, including demographics, credit history, and payment behavior.

Performed data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to improve model quality.

**Model Selection & Validation:**

Evaluated multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, SVM).

Used cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

**Insights & Recommendations:**

Identified key predictors of default (e.g., previous payment history, credit limit utilization).

Provided actionable strategies for the bank: proactive customer communication, risk-based credit limit adjustments, and personalized financial support.

**Outcome:**

Developed a predictive model with strong accuracy and reliability.

Equipped stakeholders with insights to reduce default rates and optimize credit management.
